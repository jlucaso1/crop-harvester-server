# Crop Harvest Server Mod

## Description

The Crop Harvest Mod is a server-side Fabric mod for Minecraft that enhances farming gameplay by automating the harvest and replant process. With this mod installed, players can simply right-click on fully grown crops to instantly harvest them and automatically replant the same crop type.

## Features

- **One-Click Harvesting**: Right-click on mature crops to instantly harvest them.
